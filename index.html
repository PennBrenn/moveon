        <!-- Put the full text you provided here. Keep the <br> tags as you like. -->
        So, you’re here. <br>
        Well… if you found this, you’re probably stuck in a loop. <br>
        You know, that weird space where you can’t move on, but you can’t go back either. <br>
        You keep replaying things in your head, wondering what went wrong, what you could’ve done different. <br>
        It’s exhausting, isn’t it? <br>
        You need to move on, but you don’t know how. <br>
        And that’s okay. <br>
        Nobody really teaches you how to let go of something that once felt like everything. <br>
        Btw, killing yourself solves nothing, so just—don’t even go there. <br>
        I know it feels heavy, like everything’s falling apart, but that’s not the answer. <br>
        You’re not broken beyond repair. <br>
        Just breathe for a second, okay? <br>
        You’ve gotta move on… right? <br>
        Yeah, I know. Easier said than done. <br>
        You can’t just wake up and be fine. <br>
        It doesn’t work like that. <br>
        You keep checking your phone, hoping maybe they’ll reach out. <br>
        You see something that reminds you of them and it all floods back. <br>
        It’s brutal. <br>
        But you’re still here, and that means something. <br>
        I know you can’t move on yet, but it’s alright. <br>
        It’s hard. <br>
        I mean, what else are you supposed to do? <br>
        The thought of someone new feels wrong, almost scary. <br>
        Like you’d be betraying what you had. <br>
        And yeah, maybe they really felt like the one. <br>
        You thought it was forever, right? <br>
        But somewhere deep down, you knew it would end eventually. <br>
        You just didn’t want to believe it. <br>
        Stop blaming yourself. <br>
        You didn’t ruin everything. <br>
        Sometimes things fall apart even when you give them your all. <br>
        Sometimes it’s not about what you did or didn’t do. <br>
        Sometimes, it’s just life. <br>
        You know they cared, right? <br>
        They really did. <br>
        But maybe it wasn’t meant to last forever. <br>
        Maybe it was meant to teach you something, even if that lesson hurts right now. <br>
        And what if it wasn’t either of your faults? <br>
        What if it was just… timing? <br>
        Or something out of your control? <br>
        You need to understand—it had to end for a reason. <br>
        Even if you don’t see that reason yet. <br>
        One day, you’ll wake up and the weight will feel lighter. <br>
        You’ll catch yourself laughing again, for real. <br>
        You’ll stop checking if they’ve seen your stories. <br>
        You’ll stop comparing everyone to them. <br>
        And when that day comes, it won’t mean you forgot. <br>
        It’ll just mean you healed. <br>
        Until then, take it slow. <br>
        Eat something, even if it’s small. <br>
        Go outside, even if it’s just to breathe for a minute. <br>
        Let the world remind you that there’s more waiting out there. <br>
        Because there is. <br>
        There’s more love. More joy. More peace. <br>
        You just have to hang on long enough to find it. <br>
        So yeah… maybe it ended. <br>
        But you? <br>
        You’re still here. <br>
        And that means there’s still time to start again. <br>
        Yeah… <br>
        I loved them. <br>
        I really did. <br>
        And I thought they loved me too. <br>
        You know that feeling — when everything just clicks, and you start building your whole world around someone? <br>
        You start planning futures in your head, making promises you thought you’d actually keep. <br>
        You start believing that maybe, just maybe, you finally found peace. <br>
        But then it’s gone. <br>
        Not even all at once — just piece by piece. <br>
        Slowly, like sand slipping through your fingers. <br>
        You try to hold on tighter, but the tighter you grip, the faster it fades. <br>
        And suddenly, you’re left there staring at the ceiling at 2 a.m., wondering what the hell happened. <br>
        It hurts because it was real. <br>
        Don’t let anyone tell you it wasn’t. <br>
        What you felt was real. What you gave was real. <br>
        Even if it didn’t last forever, it mattered. <br>
        And that’s what makes it so hard to let go — because it wasn’t fake, it just… ended. <br>
        You replay their laugh, their voice, the small things they did without even realizing how much they meant to you. <br>
        The way they looked at you when you weren’t even trying. <br>
        The inside jokes no one else would get. <br>
        That one memory that hits you so hard it physically hurts to think about. <br>
        Yeah. That one. <br>
        And the worst part? <br>
        They probably think you’re okay. <br>
        They probably don’t even know how much you miss them. <br>
        How much space they still take up in your head. <br>
        You tell yourself you’re fine, that you’re healing, but deep down you still check for them in every crowd, every dream, every silence. <br>
        I get it. <br>
        It’s not easy to accept that something so right could end so wrong. <br>
        It’s not easy to stop loving someone who once made you feel alive. <br>
        But you have to. <br>
        Not because you stopped caring — but because you finally started caring about yourself again. <br>
        You deserve peace. <br>
        You deserve someone who doesn’t make you question your worth. <br>
        You deserve someone who stays. <br>
        But before all that, you deserve you. <br>
        You’ve spent so long giving pieces of yourself away just to feel wanted. <br>
        It’s time to start giving them back to yourself. <br>
        Piece by piece. Day by day. <br>
        It won’t happen overnight. <br>
        Some days you’ll feel fine, and then out of nowhere you’ll fall apart again. <br>
        That’s okay. That’s healing. <br>
        It’s not linear, it’s messy and unfair, but it’s real. <br>
        And maybe one day, you’ll look back and realize it all led you somewhere better. <br>
        Maybe not “better” in the perfect sense, but in the way that feels lighter, freer. <br>
        Because you’ll know that no matter what happened, you made it through. <br>
        You loved deeply. <br>
        You gave honestly. <br>
        You cared with everything you had. <br>
        And even if it didn’t last — that doesn’t make you weak. <br>
        It makes you human. <br>
        So yeah… you loved them. <br>
        And they probably loved you too, in their own way. <br>
        But sometimes love isn’t enough to make people stay. <br>
        And that’s the hardest truth to live with. <br>
        Still — you’re here. <br>
        You’re breathing. <br>
        You’re trying. <br>
        And that means there’s still hope. <br>
        You know what? Healing doesn’t look like sunlight and smiles right away. <br>
        It starts small — like eating something even though you don’t feel like it. <br>
        Like taking a shower, or opening the window just to feel fresh air for a second. <br>
        It’s not dramatic; it’s quiet, it’s gentle, it’s you trying. <br>
        You don’t have to be happy to keep going. <br>
        You just have to stay curious. <br>
        Like — what if things can change? What if there’s more than this pain? <br>
        That little “what if” is hope. <br>
        It’s fragile, but it’s powerful. <br>
        There will be mornings where it still hurts. <br>
        You’ll wake up and the ache will still be there, and that’s okay. <br>
        It doesn’t mean you’ve failed. It just means you’re still healing. <br>
        Then one day, it hits softer. <br>
        You’ll hear a song that used to make you cry, and instead of breaking, you’ll just… breathe. <br>
        You’ll look around and realize that you didn’t think about them for a few hours. <br>
        That’s progress. That’s something. <br>
        The world slowly starts to rebuild around you. <br>
        Not like it was before — it’s different, quieter maybe, but real. <br>
        You find comfort in little things again. The way coffee smells. The sound of rain. A random laugh that surprises you. <br>
        That’s life trying to remind you — you’re still part of it. <br>
        And when you finally start to see it, when you realize you can exist without constant pain — you’ll feel proud. <br>
        Because you’ll know how far you’ve come. <br>
        You didn’t give up when it would’ve been easier to. <br>
        You stayed. <br>
        And staying? That’s strength. <br>
        Not the loud, flashy kind. The quiet, stubborn kind. <br>
        The kind that whispers, “I’ll try again tomorrow.” <br>
        That’s enough. <br>
        If you made it to the end.. <br>
        Maybe <br>
        Maybe it would be peaceful? <br>
        Right? <br>
        But what if it hurts more? <br>
        I mean you're leaving so much behind <br>
        So dont right? <br>
        But what i- <br>
        <br><br><br>
        Its up to you… <br>
        But remember- <br>
        <br><br><br>
        What if… <br>
        It worked? <br>
        What if… <br>
        It doesn't? <br>
        You'll never have that answer if you leave… <br>
